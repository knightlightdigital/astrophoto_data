# Astrophotography Data
I use an ASI585mc camera mostly for EAA, but I also save the data to process into photos later. Please feel free to use my data to process and learn.

Please note: my camera is very basic. It's uncooled and therefore will exhibit more noise than more advanced cameras. 

If you would like to contibute photos you processed from this data, please make a pull request and I will review.
